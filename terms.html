    <h2>Terms of Service</h2>
    <p class="section-lead">
      These Terms of Service govern your use of this website and any services provided by DigitalStone AI.
      By visiting this site or working with us, you agree to the following terms.
    </p>

    <h3>1. Services Provided</h3>
    <p>
      DigitalStone AI provides consulting, automation development, AI agent builds, content systems, workflow mapping, and related services.
      Service details, timelines, and deliverables will be outlined in project agreements or proposals.
    </p>

    <h3>2. Not Professional Advice</h3>
    <p>
      Our consulting and system recommendations are based on best practices and experience.
      We do not provide legal, financial, or medical advice.
    </p>

    <h3>3. Client Responsibilities</h3>
    <ul class="card-list">
      <li>Provide accurate and timely information needed for project work.</li>
      <li>Ensure you have the rights to any data, content, or assets shared with us.</li>
      <li>Use any delivered systems responsibly and in accordance with applicable laws.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>4. AI Tools & Usage</h3>
    <p>
      Our workflows may include AI tools (e.g., GPT models, Claude, RAG systems).  
      These tools:
    </p>
    <ul class="card-list">
      <li>May generate probabilistic or imperfect outputs.</li>
      <li>Should be reviewed by the client before final use.</li>
      <li>Are used only to support workflows you authorize.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>5. Payments & Refunds</h3>
    <p>
      Payments for audits, packages, and retainers are due upfront unless otherwise agreed.
      Because consulting and automation work is time-based and custom, refunds are generally not offered.
    </p>

    <h3>6. Confidentiality</h3>
    <p>
      We treat all client information, assets, workflows, and data as confidential.
      We do not share or disclose your information outside of project requirements.
    </p>

    <h3>7. Intellectual Property</h3>
    <p>
      Custom workflows, automations, and AI systems built for clients may be used by the client indefinitely.
      DigitalStone AI retains rights to general frameworks, templates, and non-client-specific internal processes.
    </p>

    <h3>8. Limitation of Liability</h3>
    <p>
      DigitalStone AI is not liable for business losses, system failures, or issues arising from third-party tools or platforms.
      Clients are responsible for how delivered systems are used.
    </p>

    <h3>9. Changes to These Terms</h3>
    <p>We may update this document at any time. Continued use of our services means you accept the updated terms.</p>
